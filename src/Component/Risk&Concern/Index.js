        <div className=' pt-2 text-base font-normal text-start'>The Company employs both direct and indirect influence.

Utilising leverage entails risk, including the possibility of greater instability, higher NAV reductions, and variations in dividends paid by the Company.

        <div className=' pt-2 text-base font-normal text-start'>We have a fresh idea and unique service. As we build our business, we steadily roll out various Platform functionalities while developing new features constantly. We anticipate that it will require time and effort and that there will be challenges along the way that are difficult to predict at this time. This implies that there is no assurance as to whether or not our idea will demonstrate its viability, develop into a valuable service for our clients, and—most importantly—have a substantial impact on protecting the Earth's ecosystems.
        </div>
        <div className=' text-base font-normal text-start'>Despite our best efforts, the following uncertainties remain at this early stage:
        <ul className='pl-6'>
          <li>Tokens cannot generate or maintain an active or efficient market.</li>

          <li>The platform might not draw in enough landowners, buyers, or contributors, which would harm supply and demand.</li>
          <li>We rely on external finance as we generate little or no revenue, yet we may be unable to secure new funding.</li>

<div className=' pt-2 text-base font-normal text-start'>The accessibility and reliability of various third-party data sources are crucial to our evaluation of ecosystems. We might not be able to complete our evaluation if any of these sources were to stop being available or if their quality did not correspond to the predicted operation of our models.

<div className=' pt-1 text-base font-normal text-start'>Statutory standards, reporting obligations, and disclosure requirements pertaining to sustainability will soon apply to many businesses and financial market players.

<div className=' pt-2 text-base font-normal text-start'>However, PropFTX works carefully to implement safeguards against the unauthorized use of our services. A token's value is erratic and can fluctuate greatly. Typically, the price of a crypto asset is opaque and regarded as entirely speculative.</div>



<div className=' pt-24 pb-12 text-base font-normal text-start'>PropFTX does not constitute an invitation to sell or solicitation of a deal to purchase any stocks in the corporation. The Company doesn't continuously make its securities available for sale. Any offers of the Company's equity that are generally made for a set period of time and price will be made solely through the use of a prospectus, which must be read thoroughly before investing. Data pertaining to the Company's investment goals, risks, fees, and expenses can be found in its prospectus and other documents filed with the Department of Corporate Affairs.
